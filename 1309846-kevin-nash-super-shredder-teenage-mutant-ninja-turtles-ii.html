Nash revealed that he was very early in his career with WCW when the offer came in.</p><p>“I think I was actually underneath a hood. Like Dr. X or some shit,” Kevin Nash revealed. “I was wearing Flair’s Black Scorpion red Mask with the black scorpion on it. I was wearing that he left it after that pay-per-view. He left it in the locker room, and I kept it. I started wearing it as my hair grew back.”</p><p>Nash was approached by Carolco Studios backstage at a WCW event in Greensboro, North Carolina, and was offered the part on the spot.</p><p>“I’m in Greensboro, North Carolina, and I’m walking to the ring. And I hear somebody yelling, Nash, Nash! And this is before the internet, and all that shit, and I’m like, the f*ck? And I look at these two guys over there. And one of them’s got a card in his hand,” Kevin Nash said. “I walk over, and it’s Carolco Studios. The guy says, ‘hey, would you be interested in playing Super Shredder on the Ninja Turtles movie?’ I’m like yeah. Okay, so I’m looking at it; it’s a card. He goes, ‘is there any way we could do it a head mold of you right now?’ Like what?! I went to a Holiday Inn; they stuck two f*cking straws up my nose and did a f*cking cast of my head.”</p><p>The WWE Hall of Famer revealed that former actor Kevin Peter Hall had landed the role of Super Shredder but passed away in 1991 while the costume was already being made, so they needed someone of his stature, and he fit the bill.</p><p>“What I heard was that Kevin Paul [Kevin Peter Hall], I believe that’s his name — [the actor that] played the Predator, whoever played Harry and the Hendersons. He passed [away]. They had already started making the Super Shredder costume. They needed somebody that was close to seven feet, and at that point, they had me listed as seven feet, so when they saw me on TV and saw that I was coming in the area. So they sent those guys out to look at me. I made more money doing Ninja Turtles than I did wrestling my first year. Just my payment for my role and the time on set.”</p><p>What do you make of Kevin Nash’s comments?
