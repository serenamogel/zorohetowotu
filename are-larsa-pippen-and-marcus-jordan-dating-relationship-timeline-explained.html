Since then, the pair have shared glimpses of their relationship with fans and navigated away from the negativity of those who see an issue with their relationship. Pippen and Jordan also have a podcast called Separation Anxiety, in which they share snippets of their life, romance, and what it’s like to fall in love with a 16-year age gap.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>For RHOM fans hoping to get a glimpse of the relationship dynamic between Pippen and Jordan, the 6th season of the Bravo show will feature the couple as they debut their relationship to the public.</p><h2 id=h-when-did-larsa-pippen-and-marcus-jordan-start-dating data-injectable=false>When did Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan start dating?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Larsa Pippen (@larsapippen)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>Pippen and Jordan, the son of retired basketball legend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Jordan</a>, were first seen together getting lunch in Miami in September 2022, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> reported. Their date came a year after the RHOM star’s divorce from basketball superstar Scottie Pippen — Michael Jordan’s former teammate — was finalized.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>Larsa and Scottie married in 1997 and broke up in 2015, with a brief reconciliation from 2017 to 2018. The RHOM star, who shares four children with the retired athlete, filed for divorce in 2018 citing “irreconcilable differences.”</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>Pippen and Jordan’s lunch date in September 2022 was followed by a series of continued dates in the following months, including a dinner date in December 2022 when they were spotted holding hands. Despite that, Pippen insisted on a few occasions, including at BravoCon in October 2022 and on Watch What Happens Live in December of the same year, that the two were just good friends. She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> at BravoCon, “We’ve been friends for a few years, and that’s really what it is. We’re friends.”</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>All that changed in January 2023 when the couple became Instagram official. Pippen posted a photo with Jordan captioned, “Checks over stripes.” The following month, Pippen showed that their relationship was more than just a fling as she captioned a photo of the couple, “My forever Valentine.”</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Pippen addressed her relationship with the younger Jordan at the RHOM season 5 reunion, filmed on January 26, 2023, and aired in March 2023.</p><p>“I feel like a lot of people don’t understand, like, I didn’t know him. I just met him a few years ago. I never met him before. I was with Scottie the very last year that he played with Michael. Michael and his wife were going through a divorce, so I never met his wife, never met his kids. It wasn’t like we had families that were intertwined. I never knew them.”</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>The following months saw Jordan and Pippen continue to show off their relationship to the public. In June 2023, they took the next step for a couple in the industry: they launched the aforementioned podcast together.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What have Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan said about their relationship?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Larsa Pippen (@larsapippen)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Pippen explained that the couple met at a party around four years before they began dating. “We have a lot of mutual friends, and so we’re kind of in the same circle,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tamron Hall</a>. She said they love to travel together, but most importantly, her four children with her ex-husband love Jordan. “My kids love Marcus,” she told Hall in the same interview.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>“We travel together; my kids really enjoy spending time with him. I feel like I’m in a great place, and that’s the most important thing.” Pippen and her ex-husband Scottie’s four children together are Scotty Jr., 22, Preston, 21, Justin, 18, and Sophia, 14.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>As for Jordan, he had nothing but praise for his girlfriend as a mother and said he “admired” her close relationship with her children. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a> that they talk daily and Larsa is like a “best friend” to her kids.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where does Michael Jordan fit into the picture?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TROPHY ROOM™️ (@trophyroomstore)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the most frequently asked question surrounding Pippen and Jordan’s relationship is whether Jordan’s famous dad is on board with the situation. Fans let out a collective gasp when a paparazzi asked Michael Jordan if he supported his son’s relationship with Pippen, and the basketball superstar laughed as he said, “No!” The video, shared by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>, soon went viral.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>On July 11, 2023, the couple addressed the moment on their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast</a> as Pippen described feeling “traumatized” and “embarrassed” by the public comments. Jordan reassured his girlfriend and podcast co-host that his father was “being playful,” but Pippen stood by her opinion that it wasn’t funny.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=false>Despite that minor hiccup, Marcus Jordan expressed his wish that his father could be his best man at a future wedding with Pippen. On October 31, 2021, he shared on the Pablo Torre Finds Out podcast that he was the best man at his father’s 2013 wedding to Yvette Prieto, and he wanted to keep that tradition going. It’s worth noting, however, that while there has been speculation of an engagement, nothing has been announced yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmo5qqo5Z6sbXPqZynZZGjsW65wKuarqtdn7yzsMCnZJ2ZpJ67qHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkraGdmrmqusRmnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
