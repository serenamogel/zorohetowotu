So far, Kat has yet to add to his statement, but she shared John Henry’s post to her Instagram account as a collaborator.</p><p>After BiP filming wrapped in late June, Kat, a registered nurse, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>accepted a travel contract</a> in North Carolina, where John Henry lives. (He works as <a href=# class=T3D>an underwater welder</a> in Virginia Beach.)</p><p>However, Kat recently moved out of state when her nursing contract ended, leading some fans on Reddit to speculate <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>they’d broken up</a>.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>When the <a href=# class=T3D>BiP Season 9 finale</a> aired on Dec. 7, however, a post-episode update revealed that Kat and John Henry were “happily engaged” and moving to San Diego.</p><h2>Other Signs Of Trouble In Paradise?</h2><p>Even so, some <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Redditors claimed</a> that John Henry “started following some insta models recently,” suggesting that could be evidence of a split. Another user was “convinced” Kat and John Henry were “done” because she reportedly posted in an Instagram story about November 2023 being “one of the most challenging months” and included a photo of herself crying.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>ABC/Craig Sjodin</p></figure><p>Kat was likely referring to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>online backlash</a> following her BiP villain edit, though. In November, she wrote in a saved Instagram story that she understood her actions were “triggering for many people.”</p><p>She elaborated, “I am simply asking for some peace, as the past five weeks have been overwhelming and mentally compromising due to the negativity. Every hour, every platform, there is something new.”</p><p>When <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>she apologized</a> again in a Nov. 13 Instagram post, several BiP cast members, including Rachel Recchia, Blake Moynes, and Kylee Russell, left supportive comments. Some fans wondered why John Henry, who was tagged in the post, didn’t chime in, too, and now it seems that might have been an early sign of trouble outside Paradise.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpuZk52yrbvRZqCnZaCWv6KwyKycZqORqXqru8enZKGdnqfGbq7RqKKeZaWleqq60q2YoKqRog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
