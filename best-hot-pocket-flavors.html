Hot Pockets should have a perfectly crispy outside and be filled to the brim with gooey stuff.</p><p>Before this taste test, I hadn’t had a Hot Pocket since childhood. I used to make the four cheese pizza ones for myself when my parents had to work late. At the time, they were sensationally delicious. Going into this, I was certain that Hot Pockets couldn’t be as good as I remembered. I mean, they’re literally just a scalding hot bread pocket of mush. They had nostalgia on their side, but my palate is so much more mature now.</p><p>But my fears were unfounded. Hot Pockets are delicious. Very delicious. It was my honor and privilege to try every single flavor of Hot Pockets and rank them from worst to best. I love these pastry logs filled with goo. I loved them in this order, specifically. Here are all the Hot Pocket flavors that we could get our hands on, ranked.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

I love anything and everything <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">buffalo</a> chicken. This, unfortunately, was not buffalo chicken. This tasted like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hot sauce</a> mixed with marinara and something a little creamy and then a ton of weird shreds of chicken. It was so mushy. I wanted big pieces of chicken with lots of spicy, zesty sauce and blue cheese chunks or melty mozzarella. Bits of celery and carrot could be a welcome addition. Instead, this gave absolutely nothing. It is decidedly not the best Hot Pocket flavor.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>4.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RANKING_HOTPOCKETS_JORDAN_INSET_12.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Hot Pocket!</p><strong>Meatballs & Mozzarella (Garlic Buttery Crust)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>I was shocked that this was so low on the best Hot Pockets flavors list.

Sadly, it lacked flavor and cheesiness. I think it could be better if you dipped it in ranch, but that is just a theory.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>6/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RANKING_HOTPOCKETS_JORDAN_INSET_11.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Hot Pocket!</p><strong>Big & Bold Chicken Bacon Ranch (Ranch Blasted Crust)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>This was the more “bold” of the two chicken-flavored Hot Pockets.

If you don’t have a choice between the two, this is the best breakfast Hot Pocket flavor. It’s just as meaty and cheesy.

It’s so filled with goo and I love that. But, because of that, I would say this is the most dangerous Hot Pocket. The innards turn into lava when you microwave it and will absolutely singe your mouth forever. While it has a great flavor, I want more textural interest inside the pocket. And, more importantly, I wish there were more vegetarian Hot Pocket flavors.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RANKING_HOTPOCKETS_JORDAN_INSET_08.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Hot Pocket!</p><strong>Big & Bold Steak Nacho (Nacho Spice Blasted Crust)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>I cannot believe this tastes good, but it does!

I had literally zero expectations for the steak in these steak-filled Hot Pockets. It was actually pretty decent. It’s not Ruth’s Chris, but it is meat! And much like the ham and cheddar Hot Pocket, the cheese sauce is spectacular. If you prefer a beefier option, this is the best Hot Pocket flavor for you.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RANKING_HOTPOCKETS_JORDAN_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Hot Pocket!</p><strong>Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza (Garlic Buttery Crust)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Albertsons</a><p>This is the best Hot Pocket flavor for lovers of meat lover’s pizza.

It tastes so good, but you just cannot beat the ratios of the original Premium Pepperoni Pizza flavor. The crust doesn’t taste particularly “blasted,” but it is nice! If you love pepperoni, this is the meatiest, best Hot Pocket out there. I wish this had a little more cheese, though.

I thought the ham would taste like rubber and the cheese would taste like plastic. Boy, was I wrong! This Hot Pocket flavor is so gooey, melty, and meaty. The taste was nostalgic. I couldn’t eat one of these every day, but I would absolutely slam one of these if I was drunk or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hungover</a> or having a really bad day (or maybe a really good day?).</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RANKING_HOTPOCKETS_JORDAN_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Hot Pocket!</p><strong>Bacon, Egg, & Cheese (Croissant Crust)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>This is the best Hot Pocket to enjoy on a regular basis. If I didn’t know it was a Hot Pocket, I’d think it was a breakfast pastry from a bakery. First of all, the crust is so crispy and flaky. The “croissant” of it all is no joke. The eggs inside are so fluffy. They don’t taste microwaved at all. The cheese is creamy. The bacon is plentiful. There are no misses when it comes to the bacon, egg, and cheese Hot Pocket.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/RANKING_HOTPOCKETS_JORDAN_INSET_01.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Hot Pocket!</p><strong>Pepperoni Pizza (Crispy Crust)</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Vons</a><p>The Premium Pepperoni Pizza Hot Pocket is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten in my life.

I wish I was joking. I’m not! It is so incredible. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since I tried it.
