And in an effort to look good for his new girlfriend, he has been working out and even cut his hair. According to <a href=#>Screen Rant</a>, Big Ed hired a trainer to lose weight and within a few months, lost 25 pounds. To show off his <a href=#>transformation</a>, Big Ed posted a TikTok video to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> with the caption, "Let's go put in the time with no excuse and look what can happen."</p><p>Along with the weight loss, Big Ed also revealed a very short <a href=#>haircut</a>, which is drastically different from the long hair he's known for on "<a href=#>90 Day Fianc√©</a>." While the weight loss is impressive, it seems the haircut is really what has fans talking. Some have even commented nice things on his Insta post like "Haircut looks sharp" and "The shorter hair suits you so well!!!" One fan even noted that the reality TV star shouldn't color his hair, because he's "rocking the salt & pepper!!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57knJocW5nZK%2Bqs4yem2aeoqS6boWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5koZmjYq5uusSwZKWnn6B6tbTArapmrKWnu6q6xmafnpmUqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
