At their home, Blake and Heath met up with their parents for the first time in a long while. They explained to their father that they became stronger, and he informed them that it was time to undergo the family tradition meant to choose its next heir. The tradition was a trial that consisted of a treasure hunt for the family's properties. Blake received help from Ash and <a href=# title="Clemont (anime)">Clemont</a>.</p><p>The brothers each returned with several items, but none were the treasure their father was looking for. Their father gave them a couple of hints: the treasure was somewhere outside the mansion and was somehow connected to them. Blake soon remembered that when he and Heath were younger, they found some rare flowers and brought them to their parents. He determined these flowers were the treasure. However, as he got to the location of the flowers, he found out Heath had also thought about this. At the site, they were confronted with an angry <a href=# title="Exploud (Pokémon)">Exploud</a>, which they battled. The Exploud was later revealed to be their father's, who had used it to get Blake and Heath to remember how well they actually got along and that their closeness was the family's treasure. The brothers reconciled, and afterwards, they bade farewell to Ash and his friends.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h2><table align=left width=100%><tbody readability=7.4272508038585><tr><td colspan=2 rowspan=2 width=25% align=center><a href=# class=image title="Blake's Espurr"><img alt="Blake's Espurr" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/0/05/Blake_Heath_Espurr.png/300px-Blake_Heath_Espurr.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=# class=image title="Blake's Meowstic"><img alt="Blake's Meowstic" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/ab/Blake_Meowstic.png/300px-Blake_Meowstic.png decoding=async width=200 height=113 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p></td><td><b>Espurr → <span id=Meowstic></span>Meowstic <span>♂</span></b></td></tr><tr readability=27.943661971831><td rowspan=5 align=left width=75% readability=27.943661971831><a href=# title="Meowstic (Pokémon)">Meowstic</a> is Blake's only known Pokémon.<p>Blake received Meowstic as an <a href=# title="Espurr (Pokémon)">Espurr</a>, which was a gift from <a href=# title="Blake and Heath's parents">Blake and Heath's father</a>.
