But even the most fervent fans of the movie might not know quite everything.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The movie follows the ups and downs of a group of women brought together by an upcoming wedding, all while Wiig’s character, Annie, comes to terms with the space she feels between her and BFF Lillian, played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/maya-rudolph data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Maya Rudolph" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Maya Rudolph</a>. Rose Byrne, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/melissa-mccarthy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Melissa McCarthy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Melissa McCarthy</a>, Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey round out the bridesmaids crew. Here are some things you may not know about the hit comedy:</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The movie's co-writer plays the nervous passenger on the plane</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One of the most hilarious scenes in the movie finds Annie having to sit in coach while the rest of the bridal party gets to fly in first class while they’re heading to the bachelorette party. Annie ends up sitting next to a woman who is equally scared of flying, who is actually played by Annie Mumolo, Wiig’s longtime friend and co-writer on the movie.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though Mumolo was originally going to have a larger role, she became pregnant and instead decided to step down.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I was seven months pregnant when we began shooting, and I had my son a week and a half after we wrapped. I couldn’t play that role, so we redeveloped it and we recast it. Now I have my amazing 10-year-old son that I would just never trade for it,” said Mumolo in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/movies/kristen-wiig-annie-mumolo-barb-and-star.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">New York Times</a> profile.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wiig and Mumolo finally got a chance to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/movies/kristen-wiig-annie-mumolo-barb-and-star.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="star together" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">star together</a> in 2021’s Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar, with the characters inspired by their time writing Bridesmaids.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rudolph was pregnant during filming</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Rudolph was hiding a big secret from the audience – the actress was pregnant with her third child with her director husband Paul Thomas Anderson while filming the movie. To hide her pregnancy, Rudolph’s character often wore belts with her outfits and they tended to be looser around her stomach.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The actress welcomed her son on July 3, 2011, just over two months after the movie’s premiere on April 28, 2011.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Paul Rudd appears in a deleted scene</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jon-hamm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jon Hamm" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jon Hamm</a> wasn’t supposed to be the only famous face Wiig’s character dates in the movie. The actress also shot a scene in which her character goes on a date with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/paul-rudd data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Paul Rudd" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Paul Rudd</a>, and the scene is even included in the bonus features on the DVD.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The scene features Rudd as a blind date who turns out to be crazy, with the two spending the date at an ice rink. Rudd’s character is set off when a kid skates over his finger and he goes ballistic on the other kids.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the scene didn’t make the last cut of the film. In the end, Hamm and Chris O’Dowd’s characters were enough to flesh out Annie's love life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It just didn’t ring true that in addition to Jon and Chris, she’d be also going out on other dates to try and find more love,” director Paul Feig explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/movies/2017/04/03/bridesmaids-paul-rudd-deleted-scene/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Entertainment Weekly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “It made more sense that she’d be caught between these two guys. Very sadly, we cut all the blind date sequences out of the movie.”</p><img alt="Kristen Wiig Maya Rudolph Bridesmaids" title="Kristen Wiig Maya Rudolph Bridesmaids" width=3000 height=2061 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-113258951.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Michael Tran/FilmMagic</span><p>Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph at the Los Angeles premiere of "Bridesmaids"</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">McCarthy is married to 'Air Marshal John' in real life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McCarthy had no problem finding chemistry with her air marshal love interest in the movie. McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone, have since starred together in almost all of McCarthy’s movies, with Falcone often taking on director duties. They continue to work together with their production company On the Day Productions.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Byrne learned Thai for the engagement party scene</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though Byrne hadn’t been known for her comedic chops before Bridesmaids, the actress blew the cast away with her hilarious antics and improvisations while filming. One of those was during the engagement party, in which Byrne’s Helen tries to one-up Wiig’s Annie as the one closest to Rudolph’s Lillian.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This results in a back-and-forth as both ladies giving speeches at the engagement party, and Byrne tried a take in which Helen speaks Thai in her speech. After the producers loved it, Byrne had to actually learn some words Thai in order to make the scene authentic.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rebel Wilson and Matt Lucas turned into real-life roommates</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Viewers find out just how horrible Annie’s living situation is when they meet <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/rebel-wilson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rebel Wilson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rebel Wilson</a> and Matt Lucas, who play her roommates after Annie’s bakery went bankrupt. The two got along so well during filming that they actually decided to live together after the movie wrapped.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“We played roommates so well in Bridesmaids we thought we’d do it for real. Except instead of annoying Kristen Wiig, we’re now annoying all the neighbors nearby,” Wilson later told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/rebel-wilson-moves-in-with-bridesmaids-costar-matt-lucas-2012318/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Us Weekly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Us Weekly</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The movie earned two Oscar nominations</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bridesmaids was a hit with audiences and critics alike, earning two Oscar nominations. Wiig and Mumolo were nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 2012 ceremony, with the trophy going to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/woody-allen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Woody Allen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Woody Allen</a> for Midnight in Paris.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, McCarthy was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The award went to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/octavia-spencer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Octavia Spencer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Octavia Spencer</a> for The Help.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The movie originally wasn’t supposed to be about a wedding</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The movie centers around Lillian’s wedding, but that detail wasn’t even supposed to be in the movie. The script took years to write, with Wiig and Mumolo starting in 2006. According to Wiig, the two were just looking to make an ensemble comedy at first.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“In the earlier drafts, for the first three years, there wasn’t even a wedding in it at the end," Wiig <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://blastmagazine.com/2011/05/03/qa-with-kristen-wiig-and-wendi-mclendon-covey-of-bridesmaids/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explained class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">explained</a>. "We didn’t really set out to make it different from other movies or make any statement about those movies... we just wanted to write a fun script where our friends could come in and play and write something that had a lot of women in it."</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">McCarthy based her character on Guy Fieri</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">McCarthy's role was hard to cast, with producers and director Feig even almost cutting out of the movie, but then McCarthy’s wild take on it made it work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Really, when I first read it, the first person I thought of was <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/guy-fieri data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Guy Fieri" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Guy Fieri</a> from the Food Network. I wanted to do the shirt, the Kangol,” McCarthy <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vulture.com/2011/05/melissa_mccarthy_guy_fieri.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>. “Every scene I would have my glasses on the back of my head. I tried for a long time to convince them to let me wear short, white, spiky hair, and they were like, ‘You can’t actually be Guy Fieri.’ Cut it off at some point!”</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">There was supposed to be an actual Vegas bachelorette party</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The original version of the script did include an actual trip to Las Vegas. Instead of Annie’s character getting everyone kicked off the plane on the way there, the ladies were supposed to get up to all sorts of hijinks in Vegas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But producer Judd Apatow thought it’d be too similar to The Hangover, which had just been released. He thought it was best to cut the Vegas scenes out of the script, which gave the cast time to improvise the plane scene and make it much longer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVomauhlJrArq3InapmpZ%2BrtqZ5xZqaras%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
