Clash of Clans December 2023: Root Rider Sneak Peek and Update Preview<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 id=h-root-rider-a-defensive-force><strong>Root Rider: A Defensive Force</strong></h2><p>Before we get into the details, let’s see the Root Rider in action. She demolishes defenses with ease, concentrated on her defensive goal, as showed. This prowess raises some eyebrows, with concerns over her possible overpowering status, which appears to render walls obsolete. Some even believe the Root Rider can outperform the Golem. The Super Wall Breaker, with its 12 less housing space, may still be useful.</p><h2><strong>Root Rider: A Town Hall 15 Game Changer&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The Root Rider, inspired by the environmental&nbsp;theme of Town Hall 16, becomes available at Town Hall 15 after upgrading your Barracks to Level 16. With the introduction of Town Hall 16, the cost and time required to upgrade to Barracks Level 16 have dropped.</p><p>Upgrading to Barracks Level 16 now takes only 12 days (instead of 16) and 12M Elixir (instead of 15M). With the requirements reduced, gamers will be able to unlock the Root Rider more easily.</p><h2><strong>Root Rider Stats</strong></h2><p>The Root Rider is a Defense specialist with a single-target assault designed for Ground units. Her training needs include 20 staying spaces and a training time of 3 minutes 40 seconds.</p><p>While Town Hall 16 allows you to obtain the Root Rider, upgrading to Town Hall 16 is required to fully utilize her abilities.</p><p><strong>Level 1 Stats</strong></p><ul><li>DPS: 210</li><li>Wall DPS: 10K</li><li>HP: 7200</li></ul><p><strong>Level 2 Stats</strong></p><ul><li>DPS: 230</li><li>Wall DPS: 10K</li><li>HP: 7600</li><li>Upgrade Time: 12 days</li><li>Upgrade Cost: 19M Elixir</li></ul><p><strong>Level 3 Stats</strong></p><ul><li>DPS: 250</li><li>Wall DPS: 10K</li><li>HP: 8000</li><li>Upgrade Time: 14 days</li><li>Upgrade Cost: 20M Elixir</li></ul><h2><strong>Sneak Peek Countdown: What’s Next?</strong></h2><p>Supercell has confirmed one more sneak peek for tomorrow before releasing the patch details for the upcoming version.
