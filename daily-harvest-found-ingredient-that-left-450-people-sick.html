I started Daily Harvest in 2015 with the mission to make it easier to eat more sustainable fruits and vegetables every day that make you and our planet healthier,” began Drori, who went on to call her job a “privilege.”</p><p>“I’ve never taken this lightly. And it’s why I’m reaching out today with the current results of the investigation into our recent recall,” she continued.</p><p>In her message, Drori explained that the ingredient was recently introduced to its line, with their new French Lentil + Leek Crumbles being the first to use it.</p><p>“We are no longer sourcing from this [tara flour] producer who does not provide any ingredients for our 140+ other items,” Drori assured. “Our investigation team will continue working with the FDA, the tara flour producer and others to help determine what specifically made people sick.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Tara trees and shrubs are native to Peru.
