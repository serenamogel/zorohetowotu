Lindell is an American inventor, businessman, and entrepreneur who was born on June 28, 1961, in Mankato, Minnesota, United States, Mike Lindell is 59 years old as of 2020.</p><p>Lindell was raised in Chaska and Carver, Minnesota. Prior to inventing MyPillow, Lindell launched as well as operating a number of small businesses including carpet cleaning, lunch wagons, as well as a few bars and restaurants in Carver County, Minnesota.</p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, he became addicted to cocaine, crack cocaine, and alcohol. Lindell’s addiction loomed so largely, that his house would be foreclosed and his wife filed for divorce. He stated that he achieved sobriety through prayer in 2009, and since then, he has been clean.</p><p>He invented the MyPillow pillow in 2004 and grew the business into a major Minnesota manufacturing company. In August 2016, the New York State Attorney General’s office charged that My Pillow failed to collect as well as remit over $500,000 in sales tax. The company denied any wrongdoing and agreed to pay $1.1 million in a settlement.</p><p>In November the year 2016, My Pillow settled a lawsuit brought by the district attorneys of ten California counties regarding unsupported health claims “that My Pillow ‘knew or reasonably should have known’ that the marketing claims were likely to mislead consumers.”</p><p>The company admitted no wrongdoing, as well as agreed to pay $995,000 in civil penalties and donate $100,000 to homeless and domestic violence shelters in California. “In addition, My Pillow must stop promoting itself as the ‘official pillow’ of the National Sleep Foundation because it failed to disclose its financial connection with the foundation to consumers.”</p><p>In March 2017, he produced The Mike Lindell Story: An American Dream, a documentary about Lindell overcoming a drug addiction as well as building a multi-million-dollar business. The documentary was shot in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Pantages Theatre.
