We also get a monitor tab for details of fan speeds and voltages (again).</p><p><strong>e-Smart Fan (eSF)</strong></p><p>Over the past few ECS reviews, one of the constant areas of praise has been the fan controls.&nbsp; Not because of their wide ranging functionality or plentiful level of options, but they have always allowed hysteresis – whereby a fan continues to run at a higher speed until the lower speed is reached, thereby cooling the components down quicker.&nbsp; It has always been a feature of the ECS Intel boards, and I was expecting to see it here on AMD.&nbsp; No such luck, unfortunately.&nbsp; We can control the single CPU fan header with a standard two-point fan gradient or by the reset options at the top.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6626/ECS%20A85F2-A%20G%20Software%2007%20-%20eSF.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>VIA Audio</strong></p><p>For completeness, we also installed the standard VIA audio software.&nbsp; Here we get options regarding which device in the system is default, and audio level options.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/6626/ECS%20A85F2-A%20G%20Software%2008%20-%20Via%20Audio_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIN3fpVonJyrXZaFdrKRmmSgp5yZsq950Z6top2nYq6tuIytn5qsXZy5qsDTnqmsZ2M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
