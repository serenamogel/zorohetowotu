Located in New Orleans’ underdeveloped Warehouse District, the menu fused elements of French, Spanish, Caribbean, Asian and Lagasse’s native Portuguese cuisine. Immediately well received by patrons and critics, Emeril’s was named Best New Restaurant of the Year by Esquire magazine.

Continue to simmer, skimming any foam or excess oil that comes to the top, until the sauce is flavorful and thickened to the desired consistency, and any trace of floury taste is gone about 2 hours.</li><li class="step checklist-item">Add the chicken, green onions, and parsley to the gumbo and continue to simmer about 30 minutes longer. Don’t stir too much or the chicken will fall apart into shreds. Adjust the thickness, if necessary, by adding water or more broth.

This one is about the middle of the road, which is the way I prefer it—not too brothy and not too thick. It is easy to adjust the thickness by using less broth for a thicker gumbo and/or adding more for a thinner consistency.</li></ul><ul class="li-checklist-items ingredients"><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1 recipe Rich Chicken Stock, with reserved chicken meat</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1 cup of vegetable oil</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1 cup all-purpose flour</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">3 medium onions, chopped</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">2 ribs celery, finely chopped</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">3 tablespoons minced garlic</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1 green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, plus more to taste</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1 1/2 pounds andouille sausage, cut into 1⁄3-inch-thick rounds</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1 1/2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1 bay leaf</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1 bunch green onions, thinly sliced</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">1/3 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">Cooked white rice, for serving</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">Louisiana hot sauce, for serving</li><li class="ingredient checklist-item">Filé powder, for serving (optional)</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=emeril-lagasse-twitter></span>Emeril Lagasse Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=emeril-lagasse-instagram></span>Emeril Lagasse Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=emeril-lagasse-bam></span>Emeril Lagasse Bam<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2dmr%2BquIylmKCZo6iybq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6txp5krKifqsCmecKhoKWcopq7br%2FHqK6cmaKasrN50Z6aoqiVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
