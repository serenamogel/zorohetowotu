We speak of "tough love." And so, when Molly (<a href=#>Mila Kunis</a>), a strung-out addict who has been through rehab and relapsed more than a dozen times, shows up at her mother's house, instead of a warm welcome, she is turned away. Molly's mother Deb (<a href=#>Glenn Close</a>) leans out of the door, her stillness in contrast to Molly's hopped-up shifts of tone. She has been lied to so much and stolen from so often she believes that it is best for Molly if those around her&nbsp;can&nbsp;impose firm boundaries. But Deb wants so badly to believe her. "Whenever I've decided to engage with her it's always been with my eyes open," she says. But hope always pushes to try again, even when experience has shown us it will only break our heart.</p><p data-children-count=0>Deb does not let her inside the house. "We changed the locks after you and Eric stole the guitars." But Molly will not leave. And the next day, when the drugs have worn off, she agrees to have Deb take her to detox. "If there's anything more f-ing relentless than heroin, it's you. That's my one glimmer of hope in all of this." At the hospital, it is clear they have been through it so many times they know the routine. But only Deb remembers the exact number of times Molly has been through detox: 14. So far. &nbsp;</p><p data-children-count=0>Three days later, the drugs are out of Molly's system and a doctor makes her an offer, a monthly shot that blocks the effect of opioids. But in order to get the shot she has to stay clean for four more days. Deb agrees to let Molly come home to help herâ€”and so she can keep an eye on Molly. The movie takes on some of the elements of a thriller when each minute is filled with suspense or a horror film when&nbsp;a character who was once most endearing becomes someone who inspires dread and terror.</p><p data-children-count=0>There are some affecting moments, as when Deb, an esthetician at a local casino, gives a facial to Molly, her tender touch conveying the unconditional love she cannot allow herself to say in words. Molly's ex-husband brings their children for a visit and we get a glimpse of the life she could have had. As in the superior, under-seen "Ben is Back," we learn that the addiction began with carelessly prescribed opioid painkillers for an injury as a teenager.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46fpq6qXZy8sLCMnZiyq12ivLe1xGapnq6ZmsRufo9raA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
