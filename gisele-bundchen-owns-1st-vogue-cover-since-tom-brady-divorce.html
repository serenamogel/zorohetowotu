Bündchen showed off her incredible figure in a sheer red Valentino dress that featured webbed sleeves. The eye-catching garb was teamed with dangling earrings and a thick metallic bangle. For glam, Bündchen ditched her signature sunkissed locks for a slicked back red mane. She also donned thin crimson brows, smoky eyeshadow and a rosy lip.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Elsewhere in the issue, which is dedicated to “art, protagonists, enthusiasts and collectors,” Bündchen is seen modeling a sleek leather jacket and a form-fitting black dress by Saint Laurent. In a different shot, the runway star looked like a brand new woman with a retro blonde bob paired with a Thom Browne frock that featured a massive polka dot bow.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Brazil native also showed off her abs, <a href=#>wearing lingerie</a> by Agent Provocateur with a satin trench coat by Givenchy. Her crown was transformed again for an additional photo that showed her rocking a distressed orange wig. The hair transformation was paired with an Off-White zip-up dress and see-through tights.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Since splitting from Brady after 13 years of marriage, Bündchen has been busy reviving her modeling career.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She made headlines on January 27 when she was spotted on the set of a <a href=#>sexy photo shoot</a> in Hollywood, Florida. Bündchen looked unreal as she struck a pose in a purple hooded swimsuit that featured a plunging neckline and a sultry high cut. The glossy one-piece was also equipped with long sleeves and highlighted her long legs. Days later, Bündchen was seen shooting another swimsuit spread in Florida. This time, the fashion pro donned a sexy pink one-piece.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Lessons author retired from the fashion world in 2015, crediting her decision to wanting to spend more time with her then-husband and their children Benjamin, 13, and Vivian, 10. The former quarterback, 45, is also dad to son Jack, 15, with <a href=#><strong>Bridget Moynahan</strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Brady, for his part, <a href=#>officially retired</a> from football “for good” earlier this month — one year after he told fans that he was saying goodbye to the sport. He played in the NFL for 22 seasons, ending his career as a quarterback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>A source told Us Weekly at the time that the athlete<a href=#> “talked” through his decision</a> to end his career with Bündchen. “Tom and Gisele are on cordial terms,” the insider explained, adding that Bündchen has been “a real rock” for Brady.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to see the supermodel’s Vogue Italia cover:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvGoqqepJVir7a6w5yfnqZdpMSvv4xqqq1lpqS0trGMnKavnaJiwKq6wp5kraedYq%2BzrcOyZJ2hpqS%2FpLGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
