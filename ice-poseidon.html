He used to stream his gaming content there under the moniker ‘Ice Poseidon’ which he had created at the age of 12 using a random name generator. Ice Poseidon had later moved into streaming IRL (in real life) beginning by streaming himself playing games like Pokémon Go.</li><li>Ice Poseidon has been banned several times on Twitch. His 3rd suspension on the platform had ended in a 45-day ban. During this time, he had moved to California to pursue his Twitch career full-time.</li><li>On April 28, 2017, he had been permanently banned by Twitch after he had been removed from an American Airlines Flight in Phoenix, Arizona. This was because a hoax bomb threat had been called in by one of his viewers. The decision to ban him permanently was controversial as many believed that it was too harsh and unjustified.</li><li>Following this, he had moved to YouTube. After spending a couple of years streaming on that platform, he had moved to Microsoft’s streaming platform, Mixer. Between January 20 and 24, 2020, he had hosted Mixer‘s first 5-day long game show called Scuffed Brother. The event had been inspired by the highly popular reality TV franchise Big Brother and had featured many other Mixer streamers and partners.</li><li>The event was a massive success and had accumulated 500 million sparks from viewer voting and 350k views. However, Mixer had shut down by July 2020 after which he had returned to YouTube.</li><li>His fanbase, known as the ‘Purple Army’, has often been called out for its toxicity particularly due to its members’ frequent use of racial and s*xual slurs.</li><li>In July 2021, he had launched a cryptocurrency called CxCoin despite having previously stated in a YouTube stream that he would, one day, use cryptocurrency to scam people. In January 2022, he had admitted that he had scammed more than USD 500k from his fans in a ‘pump and dump’ (artificially inflating the price through false and misleading positive statements to sell the cheaply purchased item at a higher price) crypto scheme by removing funds from the liquidity pool.</li><p>Featured Image by Ice Poseidon / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqKanmWgpMCmtcOopWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
