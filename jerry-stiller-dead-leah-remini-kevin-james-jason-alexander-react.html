Love you Dad.”</p><p>Jerry’s passing comes nearly five years after his wife,<a href=#> Anne Meara, died in May 2015</a>. She was 85.</p><p>After years of performing alongside Meara on The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Jerry started to work with Ben, now 54, on a series of films. He’s most well-known, however, for his roles as Frank Costanza on Seinfeld and Arthur Spooner on King of Queens.</p><p>“I was not the first father on Seinfeld. There was another father, whom I replaced,” Jerry recalled to <a href=#>Esquire</a> in 2005. “I was out of work at the time. My manager had retired. I was close to 70 years old and I had nowhere to go. I get this chance on Seinfeld. I hadn’t even seen the show. The idea was for Estelle Harris, who was the screamer, to be the boss lady of the Costanza family. And I was supposed to be her Thurberesque husband. The part called for me to wear a bald wig to look like George and to act very meek. But after a couple of days I realized that acting meek was going to get me fired just like the last guy. On the fourth day, I said to<a href=#><strong> Larry David,</strong></a> ‘This ain’t workin’. Can I do it my way?’”</p><p>Jerry earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as George Costanza’s (<a href=#><strong>Jason Alexander</strong></a>) dad on the popular sitcom. After Seinfeld wrapped, Jerry landed a starring role alongside <a href=#><strong>Kevin James</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Leah Remini</strong> </a>on the comedy The King of Queens. He played Remini’s dad, Arthur, for nine seasons. The show’s series finale aired n 2007.</p><p>Jerry is survived by Ben and daughter <strong>Amy</strong>, who is also an actress and comedy writer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You’ll always know if I’m in the audience when Ben or our daughter, Amy, is performing,” Jerry told Esquire in 2005. “I’m the one laughing loudest.”</p><p>Scroll through to read the sweet tributes to the late actor:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2B0bJkrKyZobmmvoydnJqcXaGyorSMq5ymoZ6eeqyx1aKlZqKRorK0ecmaqqimXZa5psTAp5ueql2nsqKv02g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
