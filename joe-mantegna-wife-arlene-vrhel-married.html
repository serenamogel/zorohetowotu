According to Joe Arlene is one year younger than him, so since Joe was born in the year 1947, we can assume Arlene was born in the year 1948. Though some sources are claiming her birthday to be August 20, 1949, there has been no proof about it whatsoever.</p><p>Also, Arlene was born and raised in Chicago but moved to California with her husband, Joe. Vrhel and Mantegna most likely met while they were both in Chicago, perhaps the same high school or college. It is unknown where Arlene attended her high school or college. But if it is the same as her husband Joe, then, J. Morton Sterling High School East and Goodman School of Drama at DePaul University might be the high school or college she attended.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-16853 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/eceleb-gossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Arlene-Vrhel.jfif_.jpg alt="Image of Restaurant Owner, Arlene Vrhel" width=600 height=666 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-16853 class=wp-caption-text><strong>Restaurant Owner, Arlene Vrhel</strong></p><p>There has been no information regarding her parents as she doesn’t have any kind of online presence.

But as Mia grew up, Arlene also gained more freedom, and once Mia became independent, Arlene started living her life.</p><p>Arlene moved towards her lifelong dream of owning a restaurant. Together with her husband, Joe Mantegna Arlene opened a restaurant in California, Taste Chicago. Arlene started working there as owner, managerial, and kitchen staff. She put her all into being the owner of the restaurant and serving good food to the patrons.</p><p>Taste Chicago&nbsp;served dishes like Vienna Beef Hot Dogs in poppy seed bun, Pizza, and some other types of Italian and Chicago typical foods. While the restaurant was reasonably popular, it has recently closed down in the march of 2019. Right now, it is unknown what Arlene is doing exactly, but photos of her touring in different cities can be seen in her husband and daughter’s social media accounts.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Joe_Mantegna_Net_Worth></span>Joe Mantegna Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As for the net worth, it is going to be the accumulation of wealth she has done from her time owning the restaurant. With her husband’s colossal<strong> net worth</strong> of <strong>$18 million</strong>, it is unlikely Arlene has any debts, so all her earnings should go into her net worth.</p><p>Arlene’s estimated net worth is in six digits, i.e., over <strong>$100,000</strong>, but it might as well in millions. Her networth has such a considerable estimation mark due to her being a previous restaurant owner in Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles is one of the most expensive cities to live in. So, we can expect her restaurant to have made good cash from such a neighborhood.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Quick_Facts_about_Arlene_Vrhel></span>Quick Facts about Arlene Vrhel<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table style=border-collapse:collapse;width:100%><tbody><tr><td style=width:50%>Name</td><td style=width:50%>Arlene Vrhel</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Birth Year</td><td style=width:50%>1948</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Occupation</td><td style=width:50%>Restaurant Owner</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Spouse</td><td style=width:50%>Joe Mantegna (m.1975)</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Children</td><td style=width:50%>Two Daughter<br>Mia Mantegna<br>Gina (Gia) Mantegna</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Net Worth</td><td style=width:50%>$100,000</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Zodiac Sign</td><td style=width:50%>Leo</td></tr><tr><td style=width:50%>Height</td><td style=width:50%>1.7 m (roughly)</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq6MoKasq5mle6S7zGihqJ1doq6vwMSgpZplp56zpnnAq6OeppViw7O0xKVkppmip7amsI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
