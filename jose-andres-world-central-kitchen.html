His success with the restaurant Jaleo helped ignite an interest in Spanish food in the Washington, D.C. region, and spawned a culinary empire that expanded to more than two dozen venues under the ThinkFoodGroup banner. In 2010, Andrés founded the World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit that provides food to populations ravaged by disasters. He has also starred in TV programs including Made in Spain, published several cookbooks and earned accolades including a National Humanities Medal.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Childhood and Early Love of Cooking</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">José Ramón Andrés Puerta was born on July 13, 1969, in Mieres, Spain, before moving to the outskirts of Barcelona with his family around the age of five. The son of two nurses, Andrés often helped his parents in the kitchen; mom Marisa prepared simple but delicious meals on a tight budget, while dad Mariano churned out massive helpings of paella on weekends for friends and family.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Andrés has often told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://now.tufts.edu/articles/jose-andres-life-story-one-more-immigrant-tell-me-more data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=story class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">story</a> of how he eagerly waited for his chance to jump in and mix the paella, only to be told to tend to the cooking fire. One day, after his frustration boiled over, his dad took him aside to relay a lesson for the kitchen and beyond: If you learn to control the fire, then you can do any cooking you want.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The budding chef enrolled at Barcelona's Escola de Restauració i Hostalatge at age 15 before conscription into the Spanish navy provided his first glimpse at the shores of the United States and the Caribbean.
