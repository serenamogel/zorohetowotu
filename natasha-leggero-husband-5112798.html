Watch Stars on Mars this MONDAY JUNE 5 on FOX (makeup by @kathleenkarridene) #starsonmars,” she captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> from the premiere via Instagram. Amid Natasha’s new show, here is everything to know about her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage</a> to Moshe!</p><h2>Natasha Leggero’s Husband</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Natasha has been married to Moshe since 2015 and they are very public about their relationship via social media. Not only does the Chelsea Lately alum often gush about her husband on Instagram, but she frequently talks about him in interview and their joint-podcast,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Endless Honeymoon</a>. The 43-year-old is not only Natasha’s hubby, but also a proud comedian as well! Moshe and his wife recently performed a stand-up special together in Honolulu on May 19, 2023. “Aloha! Tickets for May 19th are available now on my website, proceeds will go to our beachfront property,” he captioned a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> announcing the show two days prior.</p><h2>Their Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Although their marriage is a priority, Natasha and Moshe are also proud parents! The starlet <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gave birth</a> to their daughter in 2018 when she was 42 years old. She opened up about this experience in her 2022 book, The World Deserves My Children. “Usually, I’d be doing stand-up and touring, or working on a TV show. [During lockdown,] every comic idea, impulse and thought went into the book. I’m really proud of that, and it made the book so much better,” she said via the<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Chicago Sun Times</a>. “After examining [the topic] for these three years, from all these different angles, I came to the conclusion that, yes, we should have children, the world deserves our children. We can’t just let the idiots have kids.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Most recently, she took to Instagram on May 14, 2023, to celebrate <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mother’s Day</a> by sharing a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo</a> of herself breast feeding her baby. “Happy Mother’s Day to the coolest mom I know. Gold by @lorenstewart baby by @moshekasher,” she joked in the caption. The parents also recently shared a story about their five-year-old via their <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>podcast</a> on Apr. 12, 2023. The proud dad said he was “upset” because their mini-me (whose name remains private) asked Natasha to record her doing Karate and to upload it to her “website.” When Natasha recalled the story, Moshe joked, “What the f*** is happening!”</p><h2>What Natasha Has Said About Moshe</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>As previously mentioned, Moshe and Natasha are very public about their relationship and marriage of nearly a decade. In her book, she opened up about making fun of her husband and how they spend the initial COVID-19 lockdown. “With me ragging on him for the entire book — a lot of that stuff was stuff I was feeling, and the book was a way to get it out,” she told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Los Angeles Times</a>. “We were basically in a house together that neither of us could leave for two years. It was driving me crazy, and I was making fun of him a lot. He’s so articulate, I knew he would be able to articulate the difference between the mother and father, and him saying that he’s the Chief Fun Officer.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Three years after they got married, Natasha and Moshe appeared on a joint stand-up special on Netflix titled&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Honeymoon Stand Up Special</a>, which seemingly inspired their current podcast. Natasha was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnant</a> during the special and even poked fun at it during her jokes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme82aq5qrmJZ6rbHGoJyrp12dwrSuwKebZm1hZn94hZdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
