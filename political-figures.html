Prior to becoming governor, he spent almost three terms in Congress, where he was co-founder of the hard-line Republican House Freedom Caucus. He has received both criticism and praise for his handling of Florida’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and his support of often divisive culturally conservative policies.

He is the elder of two children born to Karen, a nurse, and Ronald DeSantis, who worked as a Nielsen TV box installer. However, his younger sister, Christina, died in 2015 at age 30. DeSantis’ parents met while attending college in Youngstown, Ohio, and moved the Florida in the mid-1970s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a brief stint in Orlando, the DeSantis family moved to Dunedin, near Tampa Bay. Raised a Catholic, DeSantis started his education at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School. An avid baseball player, in 1991, DeSantis and his Dunedin team made it to the 1991 Little League World Series, losing in the quarterfinals. DeSantis later recalled his early experiences when speaking with a group of players from another Florida Little League team making a World Series appearance, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.si.com/fannation/mlb/fastball/history/florida-governor-ron-desantis-was-once-a-star-baseball-player-at-yale data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="telling them" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">telling them</a>, “Those are friends that you’re going to have forever. Play hard, work hard… just feel lucky that you’re doing it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis continued his baseball career at Yale, becoming captain of the varsity team. He also worked a variety of jobs to pay his way, before graduating in 2001 magna cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in history. He received his juris doctor from Harvard Law School in 2005.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Military Service" data-anchor-id=military-service class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Military Service</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While still enrolled at Harvard Law School, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy in 2004, where he completed training as a naval judge advocate general (JAG) and was first sent to a naval base in Florida before transferring to the U.S. detention center in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. As a JAG, DeSantis provided legal advice to military staff and detainees.

He returned after a year and became a U.S. Attorney for the Justice Department in Florida. He left active military duty in 2010 but remained in the U.S. Navy Reserve until shortly after he became governor, retiring with the rank of lieutenant commander. In 2011, DeSantis published his first book, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1934666807 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dreams From Our Founding Fathers: First Principles in the Age of Obama" data-vars-ga-product-id=d551403b-aa7f-4735-87d7-9c9bf2e9f53b data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1934666807 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1934666807 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1934666807 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="Brand: High Pitched Hum Publishing" data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=bf942c98-4e74-41b1-ab74-aff95be489e6 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Brand: High Pitched Hum Publishing" class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Dreams From Our Founding Fathers: First Principles in the Age of Obama</a>, a harshly critical look at the progressive politics of then-<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Barack Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">President Barack Obama</a> and DeSantis’ belief that the country had strayed from the philosophical vision of the Founding Fathers.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="U.S. Congressman" data-anchor-id=us-congressman class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">U.S. Congressman</h2><img alt="ron desantis stares at the camera while sitting in a wood paneled room, he has a display screen, microphone and name plate in front of him, he wears a black suit jacket, white collared shirt and yellow tie" title="Representative Ron DeSantis in the U.S. House chamber in May 2013" width=594 height=418 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rep-ron-desantis-r-fla-participates-in-the-house-oversight-news-photo-1692319841.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Ron DeSantis, seen here in 2013, served in U.S. Congress for nearly six years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fueled by the conservative political groundswell of the growing Tea Party Movement, DeSantis ran for Congress in a newly drawn north Florida district in 2012, defeating six challengers to secure the Republican nomination before scoring an easy victory in the general election. While he had little legislative success passing bills he sponsored, he became a prominent vocal critic of the Obama administration, arguing against increased spending, calling for stronger border security, and voting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and for measures that would have cut Medicare and raised the age for Social Security (controversial positions he would later <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/ron-desantis-social-security-privatization-trump/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="try to walk back" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">try to walk back</a> as his political aspirations rose). He also turned down his Congressional pension and argued for term limits for members of Congress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He was reelected in 2014 and, the following year, became a cofounder of the House Freedom Caucus, a hard-line conservative group with the stated goal of pushing the House Republican leadership to the right. In 2015, DeSantis announced he was running for the U.S. Senate but withdrew from the race when Florida’s incumbent Senator <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/marco-rubio data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marco Rubio" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marco Rubio</a> decided to run for reelection after withdrawing from the presidential race.

The general election was contentious, with the DeSantis camp facing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/24/politics/andrew-gillum-ron-desantis-debate-race-hamilton/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="accusations of racism" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">accusations of racism</a> in their campaign against his Black opponent, Democrat Andrew Gillum—a charge the DeSantis campaign denied. The Trump presidency played an outsized role in the race as well, with DeSantis closely aligning himself with the president’s often controversial positions on issues like immigration, abortion, and gun rights. On election night, DeSantis narrowly defeated Gillum, winning by just 0.4 percentage points.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Accomplishments</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">DeSantis acted forcefully to reshape Florida as governor. He appointed several conservative justices to the state’s supreme court, lowered the state’s corporate tax rate, waded into the immigration debate by signing legislation forbidding “sanctuary cities” in Florida, and joined Republican governors from Texas and Arizona in sending newly arrived migrants on planes to northern cities. He also signed a series of laws curtailing abortion access, including a 2023 bill that banned most abortions after just six weeks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He waded further into the culture wars, particularly in education, where he’s championed the fight against what he and his supporters have dubbed “woke” politics. He’s been a fierce supporter of the parent’s rights movement, designed to provide more parental oversight of educational issues, by supporting efforts to remove “harmful materials” from libraries and battling the College Board over Advanced Placement courses in African American history. He also signed bills banning diversity and inclusion programs in college and the teaching of “critical race theory.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Florida Politicians</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">DeSantis also expanded protections for gun owners while many others have called for legal changes in the fight to curb gun violence.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">DeSantis won praise for his response to Hurricane Ian in September 2022.

By the fall of 2020, he had lifted most restrictions, reopened schools, and supported bills that prevented local authorities from enforcing their own COVID-19 enforcements on the local level.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He was vaccinated and urged others to do so but opposed vaccine mandates that were implemented in much of the country, signing a bill that outlawed mandates for both government and private-sector businesses. As the pandemic continued, he became a more forceful critic of the medical and governmental response to the crisis. Although many criticized DeSantis measures, Florida’s death rate remained within the national average and its economy didn’t take the drastic hit seen by much of the rest of the country.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Battle with Disney</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2022, DeSantis announced his support for a bill that severely limited discussion of sexual identity and gender in Florida’s public schools. Critics quickly dubbed it the “Don’t Say Gay” law, fearing that it would prevent LGBTQ students from finding support from teachers and school staff and potentially open educators to legal liability if they discussed these topics with students.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/walt-disney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walt Disney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Walt Disney</a> Company, one of the largest employers in Florida, initially avoided taking a position on the bill but called for its repeal after significant internal and external pressure. In response, DeSantis and the Florida legislature passed a bill that took over control of Reedy Creek Improvement District, the self-governing district that allowed Disney to control municipal services in the area surrounding its Orlando Disney World theme parks and hotels. The new law also appointed a new board of supervisors for the district. Lawsuits soon followed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">DeSantis supporters hailed his actions as reigning in a company that they viewed as “woke,” while detractors claimed the governor was trying to limit corporate free speech and had overreached his self-proclaimed position as a pro-business, small-government conservative. In 2023, Disney announced it was cancelling plans to relocate a major division of the company to Florida, in a move that would cost the state an estimated 2,000 jobs and millions in taxes and other revenue.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Reelection</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite the resulting controversies over some of DeSantis’ positions, he easily won reelection to a second term in 2022, defeating former Governor Charlie Crist, with the largest margin of victory in the state in over 40 years.</p><h2 data-node-id=37 title="Wife and Children" data-anchor-id=wife-and-children class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Wife and Children</h2><img alt="casey desantis and ron desantis hold hands, smile, and wave to a crowd out of view, she wears a baby blue dress and he wears a suit jacket with a light blue collared shirt and khaki pants" title="Casey and Ron DeSantis in May 2023" width=4455 height=2969 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/republican-presidential-candidate-ron-desantis-and-wife-news-photo-1692318356.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Casey and Ron DeSantis, seen here in May 2023, have been married since 2009.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">DeSantis met Casey Black at a Florida golf course in 2006, while he was serving as a Judge Advocate General at nearby Naval Station Mayport.
