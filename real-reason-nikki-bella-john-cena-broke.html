If anything ever happened to me where I had to be put on life support, please unplug me."</p><p>Cena replies, "Life is a very crazy thing ... You say that now, but you don't know."</p><p>Bella snaps, "No, I do know. I'm telling you â€” I don't want to be a vegetable ... If the doctor comes in and I have this incredible chance, maybe keep me there for like, a week."</p><p>In that moment, Cena admits he doesn't want that responsibility, and when she asks who he'd pick as power of attorney for himself, he says that's "confidential information ... You're not even on the list. I wouldn't take that as being offensive. I just told you I don't want the burden of making that decision for you, so I used the same thought process in making [my] decision."</p><p>Bella, visibly upset, replies, "I would hate to be pushed out and to have no decision about your life, especially when you're my man."</p><p>"I'm just not going to leave it up to you," he says. "I'm sorry your feelings are hurt, it's not my intention."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamloaH55e9GemKVlopqutLvNZqWio5ueeqOxy6WYZqKfnbtur8SnmGaaoqS4pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
