From <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oops! All Berries</a> to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cookie Crisp</a> to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Krave</a>, if you want a cereal that is more fun than it is food, you can certainly get it. However, on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2021 episode of Good Mythical Morning</a>, Rhett & Link turned their attention to another kind of cereal: the kind that’s inspired by other snack foods. In order to find out how true to their counterparts these kinds of cereals really are, Rhett & Link put a bunch to the test. They tried seven different snack food-based cereals and crowned the most accurate one “Snack Cereal Brian.” So, without further ado, let’s pour on the milk (or let Link do it since it’s kind of his thing), and dig in!</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

They tasted it right after eating a real Hershey’s Kiss, and it basically just tasted like a plain chocolate cereal in a weird, non-Hershey’s Kiss-looking triangle shape (or as Link called it, a “dadgum chicken leg”). Flavor accuracy aside, they didn’t think this one tasted all that exceptional. Not bad, just not a stand-out.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drumstick Classic Vanilla Cereal</a></strong><p>Yes, this is chocolate-covered ice cream cone-flavored cereal (which, by the way, still has less sugar than Link’s Raisin Bran Crunch, a running joke in this episode). This stuff’s got ice cream-flavored “scoops” (somewhere between a ball and a flake), “cocoa nuggets” (which look like cocoa puffs), and wheat and corn cereal cone pieces that look like Golden Grahams. This cereal was “pretty dang good” but “felt wrong” as a concept to Rhett. Because it didn’t really taste like Drumsticks either, R&L didn’t score it all that high. Link thought the cereal was too cone-heavy and that it wasn’t sweet enough over all.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies Cereal</a></strong><p>Guess who’s back? It’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Giant Deborah</a>! And she’s asking Rhett & Link to “stop summoning her for trivial things.” Oop. Guess giant Deborah has a rich and vibrant life outside of GMM appearances. Whoda thunk?&nbsp;Anyway, this Little Debbie-branded cereal (which I really think should be called Littlest Debbie or Nano Debbie) had a really similar aftertaste to Little Debbie’s full-sized Oatmeal Creme Pies. But according to Rhett, “the beginning and middle taste” were not similar to the original treat. &nbsp;</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oreo O’s</a></strong><p>Tied for fourth place, are the famous (or infamous) Oreo O’s. Link took one bite and noted that “the crunch associated with this blows me away. You really get a sense that you’re chewing a real Oreo cookie.” Link thought this cereal tasted exactly like Oreos, while Rhett thought it was less close to its snacky counterpart (more like a generic chocolate cereal) than the Little Debbie cereal.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peeps Cereal</a></strong><p>Even though this cereal is based on sugar-coated marshmallows, it still had less sugar than Link’s favorite “healthy” cereal, Raisin Bran Crunch. I know right?!? The bran marketers are tricking us all! Also strange – they found no marshmallows to speak of in the cereal…at first. Then lo and behold, Rhett & Link found them. It was a bit tough when they were the exact same color as the cereal itself. Funnily enough, the O’s themselves (not the marshmallows, though I’d hope those tasted like marshmallows too) tasted like the marshmallows from Lucky Charms. What a revelation. A revelation, which tasted a whole heck of a lot like its target flavor – Peeps.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chips Ahoy Cereal</a></strong><p>This cereal was a bit disappointing. It promises real cookie bits, but Rhett took one bite and said, “I would think I was eating Cookie Crisp.” It does taste like a cookie, it is good, but it isn’t quite Chips Ahoy. That being said, it was still close to the real flavor. The Eggo cereal was just so good that by the time they tried this one, their standards had gotten a whole lot higher.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eggo Maple Flavored Homestyle Waffle Cereal</a></strong><p>At first, Link thought these looked like Eggo just repackaged <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Honeycomb</a> cereal in another box and called it a day. But then the guys actually tried this stuff. Rhett’s first reaction was, “Holy. Moly. That tastes exactly like an Eggo waffle.” And Rhett grew up on Eggo waffles and never fully Leggo’d the Eggo, so he’s the authority. Link noted that the cereal even smelled the same as their real reference waffles on a plate. Conclusion: this is a great cereal, it’s not too much of a leap like the Drumstick cereal was (it’s still a breakfast food, after all), and it’s extremely accurate to the brand’s original homestyle waffles.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Which Cereal Tastes Most Like The Real Food?" title='Play video "Which Cereal Tastes Most Like The Real Food?"' rel=noopener>https://youtu.be/_bAvu7E-8M4</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKqYmsG1ecuipaRll6K6bq%2FEq5yapF2buaLCzqtkppmkmLVw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
