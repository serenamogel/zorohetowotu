On that note, for any romance aficionados out there, here is the perfect romance manhwa list to spend idling time away and falling in love.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>23. Daytime Star (2021-2023)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Daytime-Star.jpg><ul data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true><li>Celebrities</li><li>Love Triangle</li><li>Entertainment industry</li></ul><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true>Daytime Star has the perfect recipe for a good time.
