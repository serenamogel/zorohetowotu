Reportedly, the latter competes in the light heavyweight division.</p><p>Furthermore, the duo works as co-hosts together in The Halfcast Podcast. Well, they are joined by another athlete named&nbsp;Andrew Fifita.</p><p>With Brierley, Tai has one son whom they named&nbsp;<strong>Carter Tuivasa</strong>. Show Biz Corner can confirm that his baby was born on November 25, 2016.</p><p>Often, Tai shares Carter’s pictures on his Instagram where he has over 515 thousand followers.

Moreover, he has a personal Instagram&nbsp;profile&nbsp;with more than a thousand followers.</p><p>Reportedly, the baby describes his ethnicities as Aboriginal, Samoan, and Australian. In the video posted by Tai, he mentions that Carter’s mother had removed him from the videos.</p><p>Furthermore, he hasn’t posted any pictures with Brierley lately.
