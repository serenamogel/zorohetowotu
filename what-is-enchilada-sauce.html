Pizza sauce, for example, is much more at home on, oh, a pizza for instance. No, enchiladas require a sauce all their own, and we must respect that. Luckily, the sauce designated for this occasion is a tasty one, and quite aptly named. Yes, today we’re talking about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">enchilada sauce</a>! Sure, we know what’s inside the enchiladas themselves (Meats! Cheeses! Beans! Various vegetables and possibly potatoes!) but what’s in the sauce that puts this dish over the top and into our hearts? Let’s find out together!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-in-enchilada-sauce><strong>What is in enchilada sauce?</strong></h2><p>Though enchiladas always come with a sauce slathered atop them, there are a variety of different kinds. The most common “red” enchilada sauce may also be called salsa roja, salsa roja para enchiladas, or mole rojo. This is a sauce made out of ancho/pasilla/New Mexico and/or Cascabel chiles, onion, garlic, tomatoes, broth, cumin, oregano, etc. all blended together then simmered until thickened, to give the sauce a bit of heft.&nbsp;</p><p>Enchilada sauce can also take the form of tomatillos (such as salsa verde), moles, or if you’re really feeling decadent, you can even go the queso route, like chili con queso. I’ll be honest, this is the hungriest I’ve ever made myself writing one of these. I may need to re-think my entire lunch order today. What was I thinking by making myself a sandwich?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RANKING-UPDATE_CHICKEN-NUGGETS_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-8-best-chocolate-ice-creams-are-a-cocoa-lover-s-dream><a href=#>Best Frozen Chicken Nuggets</a></h2><p>What’s the best frozen chicken nuggets? We tasted a bunch of the top brands on the market to find the best chicken nuggets for your next nostalgic meal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-enchilada-sauce-gluten-free><strong>Is enchilada sauce gluten free?</strong></h2><p>It may be a surprise to some of you that many store-bought enchilada sauces are NOT gluten-free, as they are often thickened with flour. To keep your enchilada sauce free of any gluten, be sure to use brands and/or recipes that are thickened with cornstarch, arrowroot, or gluten-free flour. Always check the labels, folks!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-enchilada-sauce-spicy><strong>Is enchilada sauce spicy?</strong></h2><p>How hot is enchilada sauce, really? Well, it depends, and not only on the tenacity of one’s own taste buds! The heat of the enchilada sauces can range from mild to hot, depending on the variety of chili pepper used in the recipe. For example, ancho chili-based sauces will be on the mild end of the spectrum, while a sauce made with serrano pepper will be hot.&nbsp;</p><p>So there you have it. I take full responsibility for getting everyone who’s read this hooked on the idea of a delicious enchilada luncheon. I say we lean into it, save that brown-bagged PB&J for tomorrow (again, what was I thinking?), and take it south of the border for our next meal. Margaritas on me!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmnKebmJ65orDAZqqarZOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
