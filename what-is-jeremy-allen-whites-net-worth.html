White’s been serving up some great television currently by way of the lead role in the Hulu comedy-drama series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bear</a>. He stars as the brilliant and accomplished, but embattled chef <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>This show follows Berzatto, an award-winning chef who is thrown into a culinary environment much different from where he once shined bright. He’s joined by a crew of uniquely challenging colleagues and family members that altogether make for critically acclaimed entertainment.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>Before all this, he first became well-known thanks to his time as the second-oldest Gallagher child, Lip, on the successful Showtime series, Shameless. Because of this show, White was able to earn quite a bit of dough for his efforts, thereby growing his net worth.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false>But how much has Jeremy Allen White’s net worth grown by now?</p><h2 id=h-how-did-jeremy-allen-white-get-famous data-injectable=false>How did Jeremy Allen White get famous?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=874 data-injectable=true>If you think your family has problems, then it might be time for you to meet the Gallaghers. Spending even one season with them while binging <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shameless</a> — all 11 seasons available to stream through numerous providers — is enough to show you what a truly dysfunctional family looks like. Offering a gritty look at life on the South Side of Chicago, Shameless follows patriarch Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy) and the lives of his six children as they learn how to navigate life’s unceasing curveballs.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Minus Emmy Rossum, who led the show for most of its eleven seasons, the actors who comprise the Gallagher children were complete unknowns when they were first cast. Cameron Monaghan and Emma Kenney, who were relatively unknown before the show took off, were in the same boat as the then-unknown White, who portrayed the second-oldest Gallagher child, Lip. He only had a few acting credits under his belt when he signed on to play the role, but audiences wouldn’t take long to recognize his talent.</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Shameless concluded in 2021, after an impressive 11-season run. Thanks to the show’s massive success, White gained a net worth of <strong>$8 million</strong>. He was ahead of costar Monaghan, who had $5 million, and was just south of Rossum, who had $12 million toward the end of the show’s run. None of the Gallaghers are close to catching Macy, who’s earned well over $50 million after his successful career in both television and film.</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>As Lip, White showcased emotions and intelligence with the ease of an actor well beyond his years. Perhaps because he wasn’t already a known actor, or maybe because he’s just that good, it’s not White himself you see grow through the series, but Lip himself. His performance was praised for its raw authenticity and in 2014, he was nominated for a Critic’s Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor. His breakout performance led him to be cast in other notable projects like Homecoming with Julia Roberts.</p><h2 id=h-how-much-more-has-jeremy-allen-white-s-net-worth-grown-thanks-to-the-bear data-injectable=false>How much more has Jeremy Allen White’s net worth grown thanks to The Bear?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-16-225314.png><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>After Shameless wrapped things up in 2021, White and his cast mates then had the chance to branch out and explore new projects. For White, soon then came The Bear.</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>It’s difficult to pin down just how much more White’s net worth has grown. However, if he started work on The Bear approaching $10 million, and countless websites on the internet are throwing around a rumored $250,000 per episode, quick math might get that number up to around <strong>$12 – $14 million</strong>. Remember that these are unconfirmed figures, but if you at least consider his recent award wins, White’s sure to be worth a lot more going forward, no matter what he appears in.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What’s next for Jeremy Allen White?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>It’s safe to say that White’s financial figures have grown even more thanks to the obvious ongoing success of The Bear. For his work so far on this show, he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and has already won a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Critics’ Choice Television Award. Yes, this is plenty impressive for a young actor in his early thirties, with the rest of his career ahead of him.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Not to mention, White’s also co-starring in an upcoming sports biopic entitled, The Iron Claw, a drama that focuses on the real-life story of professional wrestler Kevin Von Erich and the Von Erich family. He starts alongside Zac Efron, Harris Dickinson, Maura Tierney, Holt McCallany, and Lily James, with the film set to release in December 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZ%2Bys7HMsmSapJyau27Dx6Krnqtdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
