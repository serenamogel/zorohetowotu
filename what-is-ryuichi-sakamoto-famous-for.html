The group’s experimental sound and use of synthesizers made them a groundbreaking act in the music industry, and they quickly became one of the most successful bands in Japan.</p><p>In 1978, Ryuichi Sakamoto began his solo career with the release of his first album, “Thousand Knives.” The album was a departure from the pop-oriented music of YMO and featured experimental electronic music that showcased Sakamoto’s unique musical style. Over the next few years, Sakamoto continued to release solo albums and collaborate with other musicians, including David Sylvian and Iggy Pop.</p><p>In 1983, Sakamoto made his acting debut in the film “Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence,” which also featured his music. The film was a critical and commercial success and helped to establish Sakamoto as a versatile artist who could excel in multiple mediums.</p><p>In 1987, Ryuichi Sakamoto composed the score for the film “The Last Emperor,” which earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score. The film’s score featured a mix of traditional Chinese music and Sakamoto’s signature electronic sound, and it helped to further establish him as one of the most talented composers in the industry.</p><p>Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Sakamoto continued to compose music for films and television shows, including “Little Buddha,” “Wild Palms,” and “Babel.” He also released numerous solo albums, including “1996,” “BTTB,” and “Chasm,” which were well-received by both fans and critics.</p><p>In 2011, <a href=# rel=noopener>Sakamoto</a> was diagnosed with throat cancer, which forced him to take a break from his music career to focus on his health. However, he was able to make a full recovery and returned to the stage in 2015 to perform a concert in New York City.</p><p>In addition to his music career, Ryuichi Sakamoto has been an outspoken activist and advocate for various causes, including environmentalism and anti-nuclear activism. He has also been a strong supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and has been involved in numerous campaigns and events that promote equality and inclusion.</p><p>In 2017, Sakamoto released the album “Async,” which was inspired by his battle with cancer and featured a more introspective and experimental sound than his previous work. The album was well-received by critics and fans and was named one of the best albums of the year by multiple publications.</p><p>Overall, Ryuichi Sakamoto’s career has spanned several decades and multiple mediums, and he has established himself as one of the most talented and influential musicians of his generation. His innovative sound and willingness to experiment with different styles and genres have helped to push the boundaries of music and inspire countless artists around the world.</p><p>After being diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer in June 2014, Sakamoto decided to take a year-long hiatus from his music career. He returned in 2015, stating that he felt better and had regained some energy. However, he acknowledged that the cancer could return at any time and that his immune system was weakened by radiation treatment, making him susceptible to other cancers.</p><p>In January 2021, Sakamoto revealed on his official pages that he had been diagnosed with rectal cancer, despite his throat cancer being in remission. He underwent treatment after a successful surgery and shared that he intended to continue making music despite his diagnosis.</p><p>Sadly, Ryuichi Sakamoto passed away on March 28, 2023, at the age of 71 due to cancer.
