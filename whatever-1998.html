She's not into booze and sex the way her friend Brenda is, but she figures, without giving it much thought, that these are areas where she might as well do some experimenting. She has a crush on a kid named Martin (Marc Riffon), who has been out of town but now returns from his self-styled wanderings, with lessons about “the passion of one's existence.” A lot of the time Anna spends doing nothing, while listening to music.</p><p>The movie unfolds episodically. Brenda suggests cutting school and taking a trip to New York. Anna visits Cooper Union but doesn't really connect. They pick up a couple of 25-year-olds in a bar. They pretend to be older than they are. Something embarrassing happens that will turn into a funny story many years from now, when the confusion and pain have been outgrown.</p><p>Back in New Jersey, there are a couple of guys hanging around who have already done time in a reformatory, and are low-level would-be drug dealers who suggest a trip to Florida. Brenda wants to go. Anna agrees passively. This trip could produce the turning point in her life; it could result in trouble that would last for years. The way it turns out, and the subtle way those scenes are written and acted, give us a glimpse inside the character of one of the guys--who has probably already taken the wrong turn himself, but still has his feelings.</p><p>The movie was written and directed by <a href=#>Susan Skoog</a>, who accepts a difficult challenge by making Anna neither a rebel nor an endangered good girl, but simply an average person whose potential, if any, is still wrapped up inside adolescent confusion and resentment. She's at a stage. She doesn't express herself very well, and often clams up, and the counselor at high school is exasperated because she seems to be drifting into trouble without much meaning to. She gets into trouble for smoking in the school restroom, and we sense she doesn't even care if she smokes or not--she just thinks she ought to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wn5qslauys3mQcnBx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
