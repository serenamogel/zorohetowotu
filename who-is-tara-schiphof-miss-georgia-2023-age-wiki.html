Tara also attributed her victory to her own persistence, saying:</p><p>“When I was 11 years old, I realized the value of perseverance because I competed in a competition and it took me nine years to win.” It taught me how to fail graciously and succeed with modest goals. It taught me why the trip is much more essential than the goal.”</p><h2>On the same day as Miss Georgia 2023, Miss Georgia Teen 2023 was crowned.</h2><p>Miss Georgia 2023 Tara Schiphof was the winner, although Miss Spirit of the South Julia DeSerio was the first runner-up.
