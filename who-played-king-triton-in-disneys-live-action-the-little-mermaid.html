It’s true that some of the remakes that Disney has churned out lately haven’t all been winners, but 2023’s The Little Mermaid certainly stands out from that bunch. At least a little bit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>The special effects are good, the set pieces stun, and the perfomances are top notch. What more could you ask for? More than that, it pays homage to its predecessor with a surprising level of detail — adding new twists along the way, like any great remake should.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>One particular standout comes by way of King Triton, Ariels no-nonsense father and all-powerful sea god / mermaid king. A beloved character from the classic film, Triton plays a massive role in developing Ariel’s character throughout the story.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Plus, he destroys all her gadgets and gizmos. Which is rude, but memorable. In the new, live-action version of the film King Triton get a bit of a face lift, and is presented as a much more intimidating merman than the white-bearded figurehead of old. So who plays him?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-king-triton-in-the-new-the-little-mermaid data-injectable=false>Who is King Triton in the new The Little Mermaid?</h2><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>In the live-action The Little Mermaid King Triton is played by legendary Spanish actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Javier Bardem</a>. Bardem, a veteran of the stage and screen, has appeared in some of world’s most memorable bits of cinema. Meaning he can finally add The Little Mermaid to that list too.</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>At 54-years-old, Javier Bardem has acted in modern classics like Dune and Skyfall — while also appearing in headier pieces like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No Country For Old Men</a> or Jamón Jamón.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>He’s an actor, producer, entertainer, and philanthropist that is as endearing as he is enigmatic. And boy do we love him for it Bardem’s latest appearance on the silver screen was supposed to be this fall with the release of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune: Part 2</a>, but because the film has been pushed back to 2024 on account of the Hollywood strikes — all you Bardem fans out there are going to have to wait a while to see him back on Arrakis.</p><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>At any rate, there you have it. Javier Bardem is King Triton. Now, when you finally decide to rewatch The Little Mermaid on Disney Plus, (it’s only a matter of time) you can tell anyone who will listen all about Javier Bardem and how great he is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMqaOasZWZeqy1zaBkraqZqbyvecinZJ2ho6Oyur%2BMpaCvnV2WsLW1zqdkraCVYrmqwNOlnGallae6orXDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
