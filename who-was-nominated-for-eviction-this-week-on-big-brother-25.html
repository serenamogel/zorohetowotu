The power was up for grabs for the four other remaining contestants: Jagateshwar “Jag” Bains, Matt Klotz, Felicia Cannon, and Cirie Fields.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>Well, once again, the “Minutemen’s” steamrolling continued with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt winning the house’s top spot</a>.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Since Cameron Hardin’s exit in week 10, Jag and Matt have run the game with comp wins. All in all, they’ve secured seven victories after the “Space Cowboy’s” exit while the duo’s main ally, Bowie Jane, has notched two.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>So, with only four plays eligible for nomination, Matt was faced with a choice. Would he break his pact with Jag and/or Bowie and nominate them, or would he send Felicia and Cirie to the guillotine? As history tells, he chose the latter.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Although Matt and Cirie have fostered a relationship since the start of the game and he told her that he was considering eliminating Jag before the final two, he used his Head of Household reign to nominate her and Felicia, two women who have one competition triumph between them.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>After Cirie sat in a nominee chair for the second week of her campaign to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">become a two-franchise queen</a>, Matt reassured her Felicia remained the trio’s main target. A perturbed Cirie chose to believe Matt, but she also reminded him that he promised her after America left that if he won Head of Household, she wouldn’t touch the block.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>Matt then offered up to her that if he had the opportunity to nominate Jag, he would — but, that’d come down to someone not named Bowie Jane or Jag winning the Power of Veto this week.</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Jag and Bowie Jane, who also secretly solidified a final-two pact after Matt won Head of Household, have expressed their desire to send Cirie packing this week, not Felicia.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=false>Regardless, this is the point in the game when the Power of Veto becomes as crucial as the Head of Household. So, we’ll have to see how that plays out before someone is potentially blindsided ahead of November 2nd’s eviction night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrpqrXaO8rrXNmquenF2bvLN5xK%2BgnKyZpLtuwMeiqmavlZq4brvNZpmin12Xv7DAx56pZmplZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 QuickBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
